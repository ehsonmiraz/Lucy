## Getting Started
### Create KEYs for third-party APIs
Lucy Assistant uses third-party APIs for speech recognition, web information search, weather forecasting, etc.
All the following APIs have free no-commercial API calls. Subscribe to the following APIs in order to take FREE access to KEYs.
*   [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/appid): API for weather forecast.

*   [IPSTACK](https://ipstack.com/signup/free): API for current location.
### Setup Lucy in Raspberry pi os v11 Bookworm system
* Download the Lucy repo locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ehsonmiraz/Lucy.git --branch master
```

**For Contribution**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ehsonmiraz/Lucy.git --branch develop
```

*   Change the working directory
```bash
cd Lucy
```
**Install requirements from requirement.txt**

*   Put the API Keys in the settings


*   Start the assistant service:
```bash
bash run_Lucy.sh
```

### How to add a new Skill to assistant
You can easily add a new skill in two steps.
*   Create a new configuration in SKILLS in **skills/registry.py**
```python
{ 
  'enable': True,
  'func': Skills.new_skill,
  'tags': 'tag1, tag2',
  'description': 'skill description..'
}               
```
